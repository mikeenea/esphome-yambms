## Supported ESP32

**Recommended: ESP32-S3 or Atom S3**

* [M5Stack Atom S3](Supported_devices_M5Stack_Atom_S3.md)
* [PVbrain2 with ESP32-S3](https://github.com/SeByDocKy/pvbrain2) (up to 11 BMS monitored with `UART`)
* [Build your own PCB with ESP32 or ESP32-S3](Supported_devices_Build_your_own_PCB.md)

## Supported BMS

* All `JK-B` BMS models with software version `>=6.0`, see [esphome-jk-bms](https://github.com/syssi/esphome-jk-bms)
* `JK-PB` BMS, see [esphome-jk-bms](https://github.com/txubelaxu/esphome-jk-bms/)
* `JBD` BMS, see [esphome-jbd-bms](https://github.com/syssi/esphome-jbd-bms)
* `Seplos V1 V2` BMS, see [esphome-seplos-bms](https://github.com/syssi/esphome-seplos-bms)

**Note: other BMS brands already integrated with ESPhome can be added easily.**

## Supported shunt

* `Victron Smartshunt` (UART), see [VictronMPPT-ESPHOME](https://github.com/KinDR007/VictronMPPT-ESPHOME)
* `Victron Smartshunt` (BLE), see [esphome-victron_ble](https://github.com/Fabian-Schmidt/esphome-victron_ble)
* `Junctek KH-F` (UART/RS485), see [esphome-junctek_khf](https://github.com/Sleeper85/esphome-junctek_khf)

**Note: other Shunt brands already integrated with ESPhome can be added easily.**

## Supported CAN bus transceiver

**Note: some inverters only accept a CAN bus at 3.3V in this case please choose the SN65HVD230 chip.**

## Supported inverter

Inverters supporting CAN PYLON/Goodwe/SMA/Victron Low Voltage protocol should work, check your inverter manual to confirm.

The following are confirmed and known to work:
